                Hi there, thanks for your interest in my newsletter. I caught the
                startup bug towards the end of my computer science degree in 2015.
                Since graduating, I have worked at various early stage FinTech
                startups and SaaS businesses.
                <br />
                <br />
                In April 2019, I quit my software engineering job to build
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justfulfil.com">an eCommerce logistics startup</a>
                full-time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Don't let the title &ldquo;CTO&rdquo; confuse you. I am simply a
                hands-on technical founder; part of a nimble yet effective development
                team.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this newsletter, I will be sharing my struggles and learnings as a
                first-time founder. Topics will include development methodologies,
                software architecture and organizing development teams. I might
                occasionally write about product development, sales and marketing as
                well.
                <br />
                <br />
                I will be writing for a technical audience in mind, developers
                primarily. However anyone interested in tech startups might find
                valuable insights in this newsletter.
                <br />
                <br />
                If this sounds interesting, you can join me on this journey by
                subscribing below. And don't worry I hate spam as much as you do, so
                strictly one email every 2 weeks. No ads, no data sharing, no
                bullshit.
                <br />
                <br />
